# How to build your binder. 

## Here is how I suggest you build your binders:

1. Area of Operation Divider - One for every Area of Operation. There are
fifteen.
2. Task Tab - One for every Task. Too many to count.
3. A reprint of the TASK, including TASK title, References and Objective.
Just like the FAA published it. (Cut and paste from FAA.GOV)
4. STRATEGY - This will be written by the student; for maneuvers, this will
also include RELATED MANEUVERS and COMMON ERRORS.
5. REFERENCE MATERIALS LIST - Think of this as an index for the
reference materials that follow. Most of this can be extracted from the
References section of the specific Task as provided in this manual.
6. References - Reprints of the references on the Reference Materials List.
7. References - Developed or collected by the CFI student. (May include
notes, drawings, teaching aids, etc.)
